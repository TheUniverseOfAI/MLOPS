Below are **two simplified restyled versions** of your project details, designed for reuse and clarity:

* **Version A**: Pure text (article-ready, no HTML, no UI noise)
* **Version B**: Clean, minimal HTML (semantic, easy to theme, no JS, no framework)

No content has been added conceptually; complexity and UI-specific elements have been intentionally removed.

## Version A — Pure Text (Article Format)

### Multiple Linear Regression Project in Python

#### Overview

This project introduces multiple linear regression using Python. It builds on basic linear regression concepts and demonstrates how to model relationships between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable using real-world data.

#### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn:

* What multiple linear regression is and how it differs from simple linear regression
* The general linear regression model and its matrix representation
* Least squares estimation using matrix algebra
* Types of predictive variables and indicator (dummy) variables
* Model evaluation metrics such as R², adjusted R², and F-tests
* Correlation analysis and interpretation of scatterplots
* Multicollinearity and how to detect it using correlation matrices
* ANOVA partitioning and diagnostic measures
* Model selection criteria including AIC, SBC, Mallows Cp, and PRESS

#### Project Aim

To build and evaluate a multiple linear regression model in Python.

#### Dataset Description

The project uses a soccer player dataset containing information about players from various clubs. The dataset includes multiple features, with the number of goals scored used as the target variable.

#### Technology Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

#### Approach

1. Load the dataset and required Python libraries
2. Explore feature relationships using correlation analysis
3. Visualize correlations using plots
4. Remove weakly correlated and highly multicollinear features
5. Prepare data using train-test splitting
6. Convert categorical variables into indicator variables
7. Train a multiple linear regression model
8. Evaluate and visualize model performance
