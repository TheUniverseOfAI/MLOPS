# 📈 Machine Learning Linear Regression Project (Python)

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Simple Linear Regression model in Python** while mastering the **fundamental statistical concepts behind regression**.

Regression is one of the most foundational techniques in Machine Learning. Although the algorithm itself is mathematically well understood, beginners often struggle with the terminology, assumptions, and statistical reasoning that underpin regression models.

This project bridges that gap by combining:

* Conceptual explanations
* Statistical foundations
* Practical Python implementation

It is ideal for beginners starting a career in Machine Learning or professionals revisiting regression fundamentals.

## 📝 Project Description

### Overview

Regression is a core building block of Machine Learning and statistical modeling. Despite its importance, many learners find it difficult to connect theoretical concepts with practical implementation.

This project introduces regression using **simple real-life examples**, gradually building the statistical foundation required to understand:

* Why regression works
* How assumptions affect results
* How to interpret outputs meaningfully

By the end of the project, you will implement a complete regression model in Python using industry-standard libraries.
