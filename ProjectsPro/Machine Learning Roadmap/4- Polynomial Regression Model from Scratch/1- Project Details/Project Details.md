## Project Description

### Overview

Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable is mapped using n<sup>th</sup> degree polynomial. If we apply linear regression to the linear dataset, then it gives good results. On the other hand, if we apply linear regression to non-linear data then the results are drastic. So, for such cases, we need polynomial regression which will capture the non-linear relationship in the data. Hence, in polynomial regression, the original features are converted into polynomial features of the required degree and modeled using the linear model.

In this project, we will be building a polynomial regression model to predict the points scored by the sports team. The project will give in-depth intuition about the business problem, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and model building. The project will also cover a detailed explanation of various regression metrics.
